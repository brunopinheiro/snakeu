## Why I created this project?
As most of the developers, I had this problem of trying to complicate simple things. So, to start reshaping my mind, I decided to create small and simple projects.
My goal was to avoid overengineering (and looking at the code, I believe it becomes really clear), creating just enough code to complete a feature, and refactoring when necessary.

But, that wasn't the only reason. Other thing that kept bothering me since the beginning of my developer life, was that I hadn't finished any of my personal projects. Every time I was close to end one, I started to have other "exciting" new ideas, and felt like I should focus on those instead of finishing the current one. Which better way to solve it than finishing one! And again, the snake game seemed to be a great start.

## Tests?
Yeah, I usually use TDD when I'm developing something. But, considering my goals with the project, and how small it should be, it felt like I could skip tests this time.

## Future?
Maybe I could add some improvements to it like new features, make controls and gameplay a bit smoothier, improve speed adjustments or a code refactoring. But that's not the idea. It should be simple, so I could finish and start working on other "bigger" projects. Baby steps :)
